this project is creaed on the purpose of Bank Customer attrination means the loss of customers in the bank due to some services for certain time of period.Therfore,to avoid these type of difficulties we need to create a model which gives accurate results of how many customers are leaving the bank in certain time period  based on the previous data.
To implement this model using "Machine Learning" and known some modules like numpy,pandas,skitlearn and matplotlib.
first,we have to fetch the data present in the .csv file so carefully import the file into the project.
in the dataset a total of 10000 rows and 15 columns are there in that our future scope variable is exited or not,means he actively participate in bank like doing transactions or not.
we use total of 3 algorithms which are logistic regression ,naivebayes and random forest.
In these three by training all models after that we test each model with the test data and which gives the maximum accracy selectit as a required model for the given dataset.
